# Verification-of-an-approximation-model-error-for-Levy-processes

In this Project a diffusion based model for approximating Lévy processes is presented. Simulations with Monte Carlo method are carried out on an example that has a financial application. 

The whole project is based on the paper: 

Kiessling Jonas and Tempone Raúl. “Diffusion approximation of Lévy processes with a view towards finance”. In: Monte Carlo Methods and Applications 17.1 (2011), pp. 11–45. issn: 0010-4655. doi: https://doi.org/10.1515/mcma.2011.003. .

The research paper gives an error estimate for the diffusion model. The practical purpose of the Project is to verify the accuracy of this estimation by comparing the simulation results.

The code is written in MATLAB. Functions for simulating a Wiener process and a Compound Poisson process are included as support to the main error verification code.
